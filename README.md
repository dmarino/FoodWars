####**caveats**
--------

- I don't like how the modals are looking right now but i don't have the time to change them

- the art still looks weird when resized but i don't have any idea of how to fix it

- when is the computer's turn you can still see the hover of the map showing you you can click but you cant and you wouldn't

- still needs more play testing 

- i know i should have create the html in the funtions in javascript instead of creating it all in the html and hide it but it was too confusing for me creting it all in js
